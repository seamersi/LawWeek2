            <h1> Welcome to Grid Design!!!</h1>

            <p class="stutter">In this grid, we have 9 items. The dimensions of the grid is 7 x 2. I'll explain why later but that is the basics. This grid has responsive design, and utilizes span in order to maximize the amount of information on a screen.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="item">
            <p class="stutter"> In this code, we have responsive design. This allows users on mobile, tablet, or pc to all see the website, but it will vary slightly in order to display the information correctly. Responsive Desgin is based off of screen size, in this project I used 950px, and 550px to display the information.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="item">
            <p class="stutter">This grid utilizes something called autoflow. This can change the order of the grid based on directions. We've used grid autoflow row in order to use span to make this project display correctly. Column will make your grid go down, and row will keep it left to right. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="item item7">
            <p class="stutter">The image on the right, features span. Span allows grids to take up more than their allotted space either vertically or horizontally. If your on pc, the Images all span 3 rows and the title spans 2 columns. On mobile, due to responsive design, they will all only span 1 grid to display the information correctly.</p>

        <div class="item item6">
            <img class=" images image2" src="images/Photo2.png" alt="Image showing style.css code with an image of span.">
        </div>
        <div class="item">
            <p class="stutter"> The image on the right also shows the colors so you can actually see based on the background which grids are modified.</p>

            <p class="stutter">This grid utilizes span, autoflow, and responsive design in order to display information in ways that won't hurt your eyes.</p>
